Working through each state think of equipment considering the impact to manual labor, complexity, or time to clean

Additional Equipment Needed:
		false bottom
		tri-clamp outlet
		tri-clamp inlet
		temperature sensor inline to heat exchanger inlet
		temperature sensor inline to heat exchanger outlet
		pH Sample Cup
		electronically controlled mash pump outlet valve
		pressure sensors to determine differential pressure:
			electronic pressure sensor under false bottom
			electronic pressure sensor above grain bed

Equipment:
	Water filtration system

	Water vessel
		Collect all water for brew day ahead of time in single vessel. This avoids needing separate float switches for
		the HLT and MLT, and if brewing is postponed from collection time, the water is in a more sanitary vessel.

	HLT with tri clover inlet and outlet	
	
	MLT
		tri clover inlet
		tri clover outlet
		tri clover port under false bottom
			Seperate port from outlet port
			90 degree coupler to sight gauge/pressure sensor
				By having pressure sensor under false bottom we can measure differential pressure during sparging to prevent
				compacting the grain bed. By having path to atmospheric pressure not through grain bed, we can *hopefully*
				prevent grain bed compaction during wort recirculation without needing stirring.
